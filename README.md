# Welcome to the repository of Fairness is in the Details

## Paper

The paper will be available soon.

## Dataset

The CelebA dataset and the Generated Photos academic dataset are available in their respective owner's website:
Generated Photos academic dataset : https://generated.photos/solutions/academic-research
CelebA : https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html

Our Fitzpatrick V and gender labels are directly available above.

## Code

We ran our code on Google Drive, instead of sharing a non-working code here on github (with the image dataset too heavy to be included), we decided to share our Drive repository :
